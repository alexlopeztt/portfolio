    <h2>Fields Report</h2>
      <p>Computer Science, Software Engineering, and Information Technology may, at first<br/>
          glance, all seem like interchangeable words to say the same thing. However, each of these are<br />
          unique in their own way with their similarities being a connecting factor. </p>

      <p>Computer Science as described by the Merriam-Webster dictionary is "A branch of<br />
          science that deals with the theory of computation or the design of computers." In other words, it<br />
          is a form of science that focuses on the designing of computer systems or the computations that<br />
          they perform. While Software Engineering is described as "A branch of computer science that<br />
          deals with the design, implementation, and maintenance of complex computer programs."<br />
          Meaning that, this section of Computer Science focuses specifically on the programs that allows<br />
          the machine that is the computer to execute all the computations that we take for granted like our<br />
          operating systems and word processing application that this report is being written with. Lastly,<br />
          we have Information Technology which is described as "The technology involving the<br />
          development, maintenance, and use of computer systems, software, and networks, for the<br />
          processing and distribution of data." This indicates that Information Technology focuses on<br />
          both the hardware and software components of computer systems, but more so in the means of<br />
          managing information. From how the Merriam-Webster dictionary defines Computer Science,<br />
          Software Engineering, and Information Technology, Computer Science looks to be a broad field<br />
          that encompasses both Software Engineering and Information Technology.</p>

      <p>Since Computer Science is a broad spectrum it would only be reasonable to say that there<br />
          are many fields of study and/or work that falls under the scope of Computer Science like<br />
          Computer Network Architects, Computer Programmers, and Web Developers. The job of a Web<br />
          Developer is straight-forward. They develop websites. However, that does not mean the job is<br />
          easy as a web developer your responsibility would be to create and design the website on top of<br />
          the more technical aspects of it. This includes the speed of the website (its performance) and how<br />
          much traffic it can handle (its capacity). I would say that this field would fall under the category<br />
          of Information Technology because a website is a tool to store and share the information you<br />
          want with others around the globe. Computer Network Architects (CNA) also fall under the<br />
          category of Information Technology since the responsibility of a CNA is to "...design and build<br />
          data communication networks..." However, Computer Programmers would fall under the<br />
          Software Engineering category due to their responsibilities are to write and test code for<br />
          application on a computer. They also turn the programs that software developers create into<br />
          something that the computer can understand and use. </p>

      <p>Being a software developer would be something I would be interested in<br />
          pursuing. This would be because I want to develop video games as a career. Software developers<br />
          are also the creative minds behind the applications and programs we use daily.</p>
